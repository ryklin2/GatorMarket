# If you have a directory named "my-app" at the ROOT of your project that
# you want to ignore, uncomment the line below.
# Based on your `tree` output, your frontend app is at `app/frontend/my-app/`.
# Ignoring `app/frontend/my-app/` entirely would mean not versioning your frontend code.
# It's more common to ignore build outputs and node_modules *within* it,
# which are covered by other rules (e.g., app/frontend/my-app/dist/, node_modules/).
