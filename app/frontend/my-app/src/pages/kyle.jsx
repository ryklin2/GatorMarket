Born and raised in the Bay Area, specifically San Francisco, I've always been captivated by strategy games and critical thinking, and I hope to channel these passions into my future career.",

The idea of creating something that merges these fields, especially using AI to enhance everyday life, is what drives my academic and career goals.",

While my other hobbies hold a special place in my life, basketball is my true passion. I aim to find a career that allows me to engage with this sport in a meaningful way, though I'm open to any opportunity that allows me to apply my skills and interests effectively."
